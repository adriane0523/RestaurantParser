<h1>Restaurant Parser</h1>
<p>This script was for Munch Hunt an app that would recommend restaurants to a group of people.
The script would go through restaurant websites and scrape specific data such as name, direction, and rating. 
The script would call an API to get available proxy IPs, then it would go through a list of restaurant websites 
(automatically parsed by the program) and parse specific information about the restaurant using the Beautiful 
Soup HTML parsing library. The parser only scraped up to 50 restaurants
and was stopped due to ethical reasons. It was a good learning experience as I learned how to create a reliable tool that can be scaled up to bigger sets.</p>
